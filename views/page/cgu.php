                <li>Always refrigerate perishable food within 2 hours—1 hour when the temperature is above 90 °F (32.2 ºC).</li>
                <li>The refrigerator should be at 40 °F (4.4 ºC) or below and the freezer at 0 °F (-17.7 ºC) or below.</li>
                <li>Cook or freeze fresh poultry, fish, ground meats, and variety meats within 2 days; other beef, veal, lamb, or pork, within 3 to 5 days.</li>
                <li>Perishable food such as meat and poultry should be wrapped securely to maintain quality and to prevent meat juices from getting onto other food.</li>
                <li>To maintain quality when freezing meat and poultry in its original package, wrap the package again with foil or plastic wrap that is recommended for the freezer.</li>
                <li>Canned foods are safe indefinitely as long as they are not exposed to freezing temperatures, or temperatures above 90 °F. If the cans look ok, they are safe to use. Discard cans that are dented, rusted, or swollen. </li>
                <li>High-acid canned food (tomatoes, fruits) will keep their best quality for 12 to 18 months; low-acid canned food (meats, vegetables) for 2 to 5 years..</li>

                <li>Always wash hands with warm water and soap for 20 seconds before and after handling food.</li>
                <li>Don't cross-contaminate. Keep raw meat, poultry, fish, and their juices away from other food. After cutting raw meats, wash cutting board, utensils, and countertops with hot, soapy water.</li>
                <li>Cutting boards, utensils, and countertops can be sanitized by using a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented, liquid chlorine bleach in 1 gallon of water.
</li>
                <li>Marinate meat and poultry in a covered dish in the refrigerator.</li>

For safety and quality, allow meat to rest for at least three minutes before carving or consuming. For reasons of personal preference, consumers may choose to cook meat to higher temperatures.</li>
